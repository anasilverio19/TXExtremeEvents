# TXExtremeEvents

This repository contains all the code, data analysis, and documents associated with chapter 1 of my thesis "Assessing the Resistance and Resilience of Recreationally Important Fish Species to Extreme Events in Coastal Texas". This includes bag seine data provided by Dr. Mark Fisher and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) Coastal Fisheries Division. The bag seine data is collected and managed by the TPWD Coastal Fisheries Division staff as part of their fishery-independent mointoring survey program and data requests can be made to Dr. Mark Fisher at mark.fisher@tpwd.texas.gov.

TXMapCode is code used to make Figure 1

The rmarkdown files are of both the data analysis conducted for chapter 1 of this thesis and supplementary materials and their associated PDF documents. 

Chapter 1 in this thesis is currently being compiled for publication.
